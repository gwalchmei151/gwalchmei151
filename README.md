I discovered a passion for Cybersecurity during the tail end of the pandemic - something that surprised those aorund me as my interests primarily revolved around theatreüé≠ and martial arts‚öîÔ∏è. In all honesty, I first forayed into it because it seemed like the money was good - however, as someone with ADHD, money has never been able to sustain my interest in anything. Thankfully, I discovered in cybersecurity the very thing that had maintained my lifelong interest in both theatre and martial arts - a growing depth where learning and pursuit for expertise never ended. I am also fortunate to be able to share these passions with others. Having had 14 years (at time of writing) of experience as a theatre instructor and 10 years (also at time of writing) of experience as a <a href="https://www.kalisingapore.com/instructors">martial arts instructor</a>, I am fortunate to now also be one of a capable team of cybersecurity instructors for the many people who pass through the <a href="https://www.centreforcybersecurity.com/en-sg">Centre for Cybersecurity's</a> doors
